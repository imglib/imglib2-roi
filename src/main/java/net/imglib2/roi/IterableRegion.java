/**
 * A region that allows to iterate only the pixels contained in the region
 * (instead of all pixels in bounding box).
 * <p>
 * Specifically, a region is a {@code RandomAccessibleInterval} of some
 * {@code BooleanType} having value {@code true} for all pixels contained in the
 * region. The interval is a (not necessarily tight) bounding box of the region,
 * i.e., it is assumed that all pixels outside the interval have value
 * {@code false}.
 * <p>
 * Iterating only the pixels contained in the region is done via the {@code
 * IterableInterval<Void>} {@link #inside()}. (The pixel type is {@code Void}
 * because, when iterating, only the coordinates that are visited are
 * interesting. There is no associated value.)
 * <p>
 * We put interfaces {@code RandomAccessibleInterval<BooleanType>}, extended by
 * {@code IterableRegion<BooleanType>}, extended by
 * {@code PositionableIterableRegion<BooleanType>} into this sequence such that
 * the {@link Regions} methods that "add capabilities" (being iterable,
 * positionable) can have appropriate result types.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            some {@code BooleanType} indicating containment in region
